# Prism AI Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development stages for AI-powered features in Prism, focusing on a Swift-native implementation for iPad.

## Milestones

### 1. Core AI Integration
- [ ] Establish Swift-based context engine for code indexing and context extraction.
- [ ] Integrate AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI) via native APIs and secure token management.
- [ ] Build SwiftUI chat panel for user-AI interaction, streaming responses, and code-related tasks.

### 2. Developer Tooling
- [ ] Implement native Swift services for file system, git/version control, and editor manipulation.
- [ ] Expose developer tools to AI via Swift protocols and async handlers (no Python/FastAPI backend).

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time collaboration: SwiftUI presence indicators, conflict resolution UI.
- [ ] Debugger integration: breakpoints, call stack, variable inspection in Swift.
- [ ] Enhanced context engine: project-wide semantic context, symbol extraction, refactoring analysis.

### 4. AI Workflow Automation
- [ ] Tool calls triggered directly by AI responses (e.g., "Refactor", "Generate Test").
- [ ] UI actions for running code, formatting, version control, and test execution.

### 5. Security and Extensibility
- [ ] Firebase Authentication and OAuth (Swift-native).
- [ ] Modular provider selection and management.
- [ ] API/documentation for third-party AI tools/extensions.

## Timeline

- **Month 1:** Core context engine, basic chat panel, provider integration.
- **Month 2:** Developer tools (file, git, editor), SwiftUI UI/UX refinement.
- **Month 3:** Collaboration, debugging, advanced context features.
- **Month 4:** Automation, extensibility, testing, polish.

## Notes

- All backend logic is Swift (no Python).
- Third-party and native Swift packages/libraries will be prioritized.
